## Post-mortem 1. Scraping URLS, 1 month ago
Here, the error was an incorrect list call. This was an attempt at scraping all the urls by combining strings and urls. It was not an efficient enough approach anyway. The target of going each of the 435 pages did not appear to be difficult. At this point I dont really think I understood how many errors and different formatting would occur when I attempted to visit each representative's personal page. I was very much attempting to write clean code, but I think for a long time now I've struggled with writing code efficiently, my problem is the step after the step of identifying.

## Post-mortem 2. 22 days ago
This certainly should have been saved over the previous file. I think what frustrates me about this code is that I'm not paying attention to even the most simplistic methods of writing efficiently, creating lists of identifiers for example. I do recall the writing to text file taking me a while to figure out, now I'm aware of a shorter method. what I'm unhappy with is the only 7 lines of comment codes and the failiure to use chunks in any meaningful way.

## Post-mortem 3. 20 days ago
I managed to scrape the url of the state level representatives for the first time. I'm not impressed by the lack of comments, seems like I stopped halfway through again. I do like that I am playing with saving data and using it again data from a written format. It obviously becomes very significant in the development of a project. This should be its own standalone file. I think most of the code becomes integrated into a bigger process later.

This one is well-coded. This was the major switch in wikipedia pages. It was touch to find this one, I ended up altering the url to see if it existed because they never came up on google. I grabed the list of states from a page on the web, it was simplest to scrape. I think method could be simplified.

This one could have been saved over the last one. I created a new file because I wanted to start from a blank slate. BIG mistake. it was not well-commented, ultimately wasn't much different. I did get further along here. Working on the problem with creating of individual units as terms ended up being less difficult than I thought. It took a lot of thought on my window to get to my ultimate solution, which could be optimized, but isn't so bad.

# Artifacts
Some of the work files from abandoned parts of the project, not all of them, some have been deleted.
